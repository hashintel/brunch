# Plan

<!-- Phases are temporal groups, ordered. Within each phase, slices and spikes are ordered
     by uncertainty first, dependency second (retire risk early).
     Status: not-started | in-progress | done -->

## Phase 1: Foundation

<!-- Prove the stack works end-to-end, then add persistence. All subsequent phases depend on this. -->

### Slices

1. **Walking skeleton: SDK → SSE → React** `FE-534` `done` — I1, I2, I3, I4
2. **SQLite foundation + project persistence** `FE-535` `done` — I5, I6

## Phase 2: Architecture `done`

3. **Turn tree schema + API** `FE-544` `done` — I6, I9, I10
3c. **Drizzle ORM + core extraction** `FE-552` `done` — I11, I12, I13
3d. **Multi-project routing** `FE-553` `done` — I14, I15

## Phase 3: Interview Engine `done`

<!-- Spikes -->
- Spike: **Observer extraction fidelity** `FE-557` `done` — narrowly validated observer extraction for the original decisions/assumptions ontology (≥80% capture rate); broadened knowledge-layer extraction still needs follow-up coverage
- Spike: **Raw Anthropic SDK** `done` — invalidated A2, validated A26, led to D30

<!-- Slices -->
3b. **Rich chat UI** `FE-541` `done` — I7
4. **Structured interview: scope phase** `FE-554` `done` — I16
4a. **Parts-based persistence + context builders** `FE-555` `done` — I17, I18, I19
4b. **Structured interview: client UI** `FE-556` `done` — I17↑, I18↑
4c. **UI foundation: shadcn/ui + Tailwind 4 + AI Elements** `FE-558` `done`
5. **Observer agent + entity persistence** `FE-537` `done` — I20, I21, I22
6. **Entity sidebar (read-only)** `FE-538` `done` — I23
6b. **AI SDK-native chat pivot** `FE-559` `done` — I21↑, I22↑, I23↑
6b1. **Workspace seam characterization oracle** `done` — I24
    - Purpose: add a client integration harness around the interview workspace before the state-ownership refactor
    - Coverage: initial hydration from persisted turns, same-project refresh stability, observer-result sidebar reactivity, option-selection follow-through
    - Unblocks: 6c live streaming fix, workspace state-ownership refactor commits

## Phase 4: Interaction + Knowledge Foundations `done`

### Slices

6c. **Live streaming fix** `done`
    - Shipped: workspace controller projects streamed `tool-ask_question` into visible turn card before durable route refresh
    - Established: I24 (workspace seam)

6d. **Flexible turn-response model** `done`
    - Shipped: `data-turn-response` parts carry zero/one/many selections + free-text; workspace stages multi-select locally
    - Established: I44 (turn response seam)

6e. **Generic knowledge layer schema + sidebar projection** `done`
    - Shipped: `knowledge_item` + `turn_knowledge_item` + `knowledge_edge` persistence; kind-specific entity collections + typed relationships
    - Established: I48 (generic knowledge seam)

6f. **Phase-aware observer extraction** `done`
    - Shipped: observer biases extraction by phase — scope→goals/terms/contexts/constraints, design→decisions/assumptions, requirements→requirements, criteria→criteria
    - Established: I54 (observer widening seam)

## Phase 5: Mode Closure + Full Interview

### Slices

7. **Explicit phase outcomes + scope closure** `done`
   - Shipped: durable `phase_outcome` records; `data-phase-summary` + `data-confirmation` chat seams; workspace header phase status
   - Established: I72 (phase-close seam)
   - Debt: shared closeability/readiness/closure-basis generalization folded into slice 8

7a. **Knowledge-layer redesign spike** `done`
   - Shipped: canonical ontology (8 kinds); `framing` demoted to migration alias; primary review UX is dedicated knowledge workspace

7b. **Canonical knowledge model foundation + cutover seam** `done`
   - Shipped: registry/observer/entities/sidebar use canonical kinds; decisions/assumptions persist through generic seam
   - Established: I48 (updated), I54 (updated)

8. **Design mode (commitment / exploration)** `done`
   - Shipped: shared workflow projection replaces scope-only seam; discriminated phase-close commands; force-close + durable closure basis
   - Established: I72 (updated)

9. **Requirements-review mode** `done`
   - Shipped: interviewer grounded in requirement inventory; targeted approve/reject; closeability from full review coverage; shared phase-close reused for requirements → criteria handoff
   - Established: I87 (requirements-review seam)

10.1 **Criteria grounding + first synthesis/review loop** `done`
     - Shipped: criteria interviewer grounded in approved requirements; initial criterion round-trips through observer/entity persistence
     - Established: I97 (criteria-review grounding)

10.2 **Explicit criterion review state + minimal closeability** `done`
     - Shipped: per-criterion approve/reject with latest-action-wins projection; closeability from full criterion review coverage
     - Established: I98 (criteria-review seam)

10.3 **Criteria closure + completed workflow state** `done`
     - Shipped: shared phase-close seam closes criteria; all four phases project `closed` with no stale active phase
     - Established: I99 (criteria closure)

## Phase 6: Readiness Surfaces + Export

<!-- Surface readiness outside the workspace, add a broader knowledge workspace/review surface,
     then export from the reviewed knowledge layer. Generalized revisit is deferred until the
     readiness/export path is stable enough to absorb branch invalidation semantics without
     widening this phase further. -->

### Slices

11a. **Project dashboard workflow state** `FE-573` `done`
     - Shipped: project list shows per-phase status/readiness/closure-basis from durable phase outcomes + live workflow projection
     - Distinguishes forced-close debt from ordinary closed state

12a. **Knowledge workspace review surface** `FE-574` `done`
     - Shipped: read-only `/project/:id/knowledge` route with kind-grouped items, review badges, and dependency edges
     - First dedicated review surface beyond sidebar

12b. **Spec export from the reviewed knowledge layer** `FE-574` `done`
     - Shipped: markdown export from active-path reviewed knowledge with closure caveats; gated on all phases closed
     - Evidence: export.test.ts, KnowledgeWorkspace.test.tsx

11b. **Fixture scenarios + dev seed CLI** `done`
     - Shipped: shared fixture module + `npm run seed <scenario>` CLI; test files import from shared module
     - 10 programmatic scenarios cover all workflow states

11c. **Rich fixture generation for outer-loop testing** `done`
     - Shipped: JSON manifest seeder with issue-tracker domain (5 scenarios, 27 knowledge items, 14 edges, 24 turns)
     - Evidence: 223 tests pass; all 10 scenarios seed; knowledge workspace + export render from seeded state

13a. **Review lifecycle refinement across requirements + criteria** — Revisit the first-cut review model only after the thin end-to-end path is working, and add the deferred variants that were intentionally excluded from slices 9 and 10 so the app kept moving toward completion. Depends on 12a + 12b. `not-started`
     - Requirements: → SPEC.md §Requirements #11, #12, #13
     - Assumptions: → SPEC.md §Assumptions A15, A40
     - Decisions: → SPEC.md §Decisions D17, D61, D65, D66, D69
     - Candidate invariant goals: richer review actions and invalidation semantics can evolve without regressing the thin end-to-end workflow; deferred edge-case variants are collected in one explicit refinement slice rather than fragmenting earlier mode slices
     - Invariants to respect: → SPEC.md §Invariants I18, I21, I24
     - Acceptance: deferred review refinements such as edit/add/merge/stale semantics across requirements and criteria can land behind one cross-cutting slice without regressing completion, export, or workflow-state coherence
     - **Verification approach**: inner — mutation/read-model/invalidation tests per refinement added. Outer — manual cross-phase review lifecycle walkthrough after the dedicated knowledge workspace exists.

## Phase 7: Distribution

<!-- Package and ship. -->

### Slices

14. **npx distribution + CLI** — `bin` entry, launcher starts Express (serves built Vite assets + API on one port), opens browser. `npx brunch` for web UI. `npx brunch [command]` for CLI operations. Single env var: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. `not-started`
    - Requirements: → SPEC.md §Requirements #1
    - Decisions: → SPEC.md §Decisions D20
    - Candidate invariant goals: packaged launcher preserves working DB lifecycle and browser boot flow
    - Invariants to respect: → SPEC.md §Invariants I1, I2, I4, I5
    - Acceptance: `npx brunch` with key in scope opens working app

## Phase 8: Post-Distribution Hardening

<!-- Defer dependency-risk changes until the packaged app exists and can be regression-tested as a distributed artifact. -->

### Slices

15. **Drizzle Kit audit remediation** — Revisit the current `npm audit` finding on `drizzle-kit` after distribution is stable. Do not use `npm audit fix --force`, which currently resolves to `drizzle-kit@0.18.1`; that downgrade crosses the modern config boundary and is not a safe path for this repo. Instead, validate a non-vulnerable upgrade path (currently the `1.0.0-beta` line) against this app's SQLite config, migration history, and `studio` workflow before changing dependencies. `not-started`
    - Requirements: → SPEC.md §Requirements #1
    - Candidate invariant goals: packaged distribution remains stable while the Drizzle toolchain is upgraded off the vulnerable `@esbuild-kit/*` loader chain
    - Invariants to respect: → SPEC.md §Invariants I1, I2, I4, I5
    - Acceptance: chosen `drizzle-kit` version removes the vulnerable loader chain, keeps `drizzle.config.ts` compatible, preserves existing migration history, and `npm run studio` still works against the existing SQLite database
    - **Verification approach**: inner — dependency tree/audit check plus config-load and migration/studio smoke tests. Outer — manual `npm run studio` walkthrough on the distributed app path.

## Horizon

<!-- Future work not yet broken into slices. Revisit after Phase 7. -->

- Deferred from Phase 6: `11. Generalized revisit: branch + readiness invalidation` — revisit any earlier turn, branch from that point, restore the interview there, and invalidate downstream phase outcomes / review state from the affected frontier. Re-scope after the readiness/export path stabilizes.
- Headless interview driver — a programmatic harness that drives the real `/api/projects/:id/chat` endpoint with scripted or LLM-chosen answers, capturing the resulting DB state as a fixture manifest. Replaces LLM content generation (11c approach C) with real pipeline replay (approach A). Probes the future CLI adapter and MCP adapter surface. Second fixture domain candidate: resource booking system (TEST_PROBLEMS.md #9).
- CLI interactive interview mode (terminal-based interview using core's DomainEvent stream)
- MCP server adapter (expose core operations as MCP tools)
- Turn tree visualization (git-log-style branch graph in sidebar)
- Knowledge graph visualization (goal / term / context / constraint / assumption / decision / requirement / criterion view)
- Exploratory pathway (for projects where the goal itself is unclear)
- Project characterization kickoff mode (ToolLoopAgent with core tools explores existing codebase before interview)
- Multi-provider support via AI SDK provider abstraction (architecturally possible now)
- Export to GitHub Issues, Linear, YAML task definitions

### Parallelism opportunities

- Phase 6 is fully done (11a, 11b, 11c, 12a, 12b all complete).
- 13a (review lifecycle refinement) is explicitly deferred; it should collect rarer review variants now that the thin end-to-end path is stable.
- 14 (npx) is unblocked and is the next critical-path slice.
- 15 (drizzle-kit audit remediation) should wait until 14 lands.
